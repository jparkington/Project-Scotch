    '''
    Bitboards are an efficient way to represent chess positions using 64-bit integers, with each bit corresponding to a square on the chessboard. 
    They offer several advantages, including memory efficiency, fast bitwise operations on modern CPUs, simplified move generation, and ease of implementation. 
    By using bitboards, our analysis with Matcher will have a relatively small memory footprint and more maintainable code.

    Attributes:
        white_turn     (bool) : A boolean indicating whether or not it is white's turn to move.
        move_number    (int)  : The move number for the current position.
        move_notation  (str)  : The move notation in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) for the current position.
        final_move     (bool) : A boolean indicating whether or not this position was the last one in the PGN file.
        bitboards      (dict) : A dictionary containing the bitboards for each piece type and color.

    Methods:
        get_bitboards : Converts a python-chess Board object into a set of bitboards.
        apply_move    : Applies a given move to the current position and updates the bitboards, move history, and player turn accordingly.
        get_board     : Generates a 2D list representing the board state at a given ply.
        __str__       : Returns a textual representation of the board state at a given ply for easy visualization.
