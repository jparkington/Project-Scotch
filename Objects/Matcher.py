and relevant information in a chess game analysis tool.

    Attributes:
        position_database (dict or DataFrame): A data structure storing existing games and their corresponding board states for efficient searching and matching.

    Methods:

        find_best_matches(user_position, num_matches): Compares a user-inputted position with positions in the position_database and returns the num_matches best matching games and their relevant information (e.g., opening names, number of moves, plausible continuations).
        find_partial_matches(user_position):           Searches the position_database for positions with similar board states and move histories to the user-inputted position.
