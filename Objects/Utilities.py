class Utility:
    '''
    The Utility class provides methods for data storage and retrieval. It allows for reading from and writing to 
    Parquet files, and provides convenience methods for managing Parquet datasets.

    Attributes:
        pq_name  (str) : The name of the Parquet dataset.
        pq_path  (str) : The path to the Parquet dataset.
        pgn_path (str) : The path to the PGN file.

    Methods:
        open_file    : Opens a file dialog and returns the selected file path as a string.
        from_parquet : Reads a set of partitions from the Parquet dataset and returns them as a DataFrame. 
        get_metadata : Retrieves the metadata for each partition in the Parquet dataset.
        __call__     : Returns the path to the PGN file, which is obtained either from the command line arguments or a file dialog.

        Opens a file dialog and returns the selected file path as a string. The file type defaults to "PGN".

        Parameters:
            file_type: The type of file to open. Defaults to "PGN".
